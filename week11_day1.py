#Step 1: create variables
first_name="Giovanni"
age="16"
favorite_color="green"
favorite_number="8"

#Step 2: Pratice String Operations
# 1. Print your name in uppercase
print(first_name.upper())
# 2. Print how many letters are in your name
print(len(first_name))
# 3. Combine your name and favorite color into one message
print("my name is" b:{first_name}) and {favorite_color}")
#  Step 3: Math Practice
# Use arithmetic operators with your favorite number
num1=3
num2=3
num3= int(input("what is your 3rd fav")) #5
num4= int(input("what is you 5th fav")) #4
print(num1 + num2) #output 6
print(num3 +num4) # output 54

#  Step 4: User Input Practice
# Ask the user two questions and combine answers
print("how many dogs do you have?")
print("how was your day?")

day= "good"
number_dog="1"


# ⚙️ Step 5: Final Challenge (combine it all)
# Use math and strings together

print(f:{name}) and {}")
